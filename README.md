1. Understanding Jekyll
Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more.
To add a new page to the site, all you need to do is create a markdown file in the root directory. For example, to create a new page at https://zcoregroup.com/about, create a file named about.md and add the following content:
---
layout: page
title: About
permalink: /about/
---
This will create a page that uses the layout found in _layouts/page.html and sets the title of the page to About. The permalink is the URL of the page. The page will be accessible at https://zcoregroup.com/about.

2. Directory Structure
2.1 _about - Contains the about page content (about-us.md, years-experience.md).
2.2 _action - Contains the action page content (call-to-action.md).
2.3 _careers - Contains the careers page content (open-position-1 -- open-position-6.md). These files are used to generate the open positions on the careers page.
2.4 _contact - Contains the contact page content (phone.md, email.md, offices.md, contact-us.md). These files are used to generate the contact cards on the contact page.
2.5 _counter - Contains the counter page content (counter-1 -- counter-4.md). These files serve text into the counter animation that is handled by the counter.js script.
