Our founder launched zCG with an aspiration to close the collaboration gap between technology
and federal agencies. He carefully selected the experienced team that would execute his dream.
In late 2022, zCG expanded our services to include process improvement, data analytics, program
and project management, change management, education and training, software development,
and executive support.

With a background including active-duty service with the United States Marine Corps,
employment with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and account executive experience with a leading
consulting firm, our founder is using his leadership skills to accelerate a meaningful impact for
our partners and in society.
